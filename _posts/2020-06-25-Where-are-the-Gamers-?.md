  In this post we will be exploring the dataset 'Video Game Sales' from Kaggle.com. Using this data set we will try to answer what region of the world has the highest concentration of video game players, as well as, what kind of viedo games are they playing? Our dataset gives us the number of video game sales for the top selling 16000 video games by region. In order to get a an initial look into our data, I made a line graph plotting the top 100 selling video games by their sales in each region.

## North America, Eruope, and Japan sales of the top 100 Video games
