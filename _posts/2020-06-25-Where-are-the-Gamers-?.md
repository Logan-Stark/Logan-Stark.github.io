  In this post we will be exploring the dataset 'Video Game Sales' from Kaggle.com. Using this data set we will try to answer what region of the world has the highest concentration of video game players, as well as, what kind of video games are they playing? Our dataset gives us the number of video game sales for the top selling 16000 video games by region. The 3 major regions that are used when looking at the sale of Video games are North America, Europe, Japan, and Other. The region of Other in this data set pertains to the rest of the world. Since the sales in Other are much smaller than the other three we will not use it in our analysis. In order to get a an initial look into our data, I made a line graph plotting the top 100 selling video games by their sales in each region.

## North America, Eruope, and Japan sales of the top 100 Video games


By looking at this graph we can see what kind of trends exist between the three regions as well as gain insight into the rest off our data. we can see that the line representing North America, on average, rises above both Europe and Japan in units sold. There is a similar trend between with europes sales rising above that of japan. From this we can then total number of sales for North america, Europe and Japan and graph them to fully show the difference in sales.
