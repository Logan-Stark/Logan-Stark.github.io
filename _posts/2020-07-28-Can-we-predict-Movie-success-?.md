## Introduction

  One of the things i have missed the most during quarantine is going out to the movies. Since all the theatres are closed its made me think "what makes a movie successful?". This post will go through what it takes to predict a movies success. There are hundreds of thousands of different movies that have been produced over the years. some of these movies break box office records while while others will go unheard of. 
  
  ## Data exploration and Target selection
  
  Using data gathered from the Movies.Meta dataset from kaggle.com i will make models that will help predict success of a movie.for our data i created a new feature called [success] to help us gauge how successful a given movie is. i made this feature by taking the gross revenue made from a movie and dividing it by its budget. by doing this we recieve a number that shows how much money was made in realtion to the money already spent on the budget. for instance if a movies success is less than 1 we know the movie spent more than it made. any movie that has a succes of less than 1 we will call unsuccessful and any gretaer than 1 successful
